# Analyzing User Progress in Wikispedia Gameplay

## Abstract

In order to identify the changes in users' actual skills and efficiency with time and with increased experience, this study analyses the behaviour of players of the game "Wikispeedia", a Wikipedia traversal game. We study the chosen paths and its length, as well as the type and content of the articles traversed. We seek to check whether playing Wikispeedia makes players more aware of the connections between articles, and see whether they resort to using hubs when traversing wikispeedia.

## Research Questions

1. Is there a correlation between time passed and user improvement in gameplay? (for users who play games with a wide spread in the timestamp of each game)
2. Do players change their behaviours after playing many games? (do they more easily bridge the gap between different topics to reach their destination?)

## Methods

To gain a thorough grasp of user behaviour and evolution in the Wikispedia dataset we will be using CCDfs so we can monitor the change in efficiency as the number of games played increases, giving us a dynamic representation of user growth. We will evaluate the importance of our results using statistical analysis, guaranteeing the validity of our judgements. Comparative analysis will be used to compare different data clusters, like players that play different numbers of games (less than 20, 20–150, and more than 200 games). A personalised efficiency measure will be developed that accounts for characteristics such as game time, path length, and user experience, and may even go so far as to consider the semantic intricacy of selected paths. The clear display of trends, correlations, and causation between variables will be made easier with the use of visualisation techniques with libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Finally, hypothesis testing will thoroughly examine the importance of the learned information, to confirm the validity of our conclusions.

## Proposed Timeline

1. **Week 3-5:** Brainstorming: Each member comes up with 3 different ideas to be assessed by the TAs

2. **Week 7-9:** Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and extract relevant features.
   - Identify patterns and trends within user behavior.
   - Visualize key insights and relationships within the dataset.

3. **Week 12-14:** Statistical and Final Analysis and Documentation
   - Apply statistical methods to further confirm relationships between variables.
   - Conduct hypothesis testing to validate findings.
   - Summarize key findings and insights.
   - Prepare the final documentation to be presented.

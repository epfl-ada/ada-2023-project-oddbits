# Analyzing User's Choice of Countries in Pathfinding in Wikispeedia
## Abstract
Wikispeedia is a game about fast and efficient pathfinding from two articles. Oftentimes, users pass through articles more familiar to them, instead of jumping between unfamiliar articles. A readily available and often familiar recourse is country articles. But which countries do they pass through? Why do they choose *those* countries? Is it because they will lead to better success rates within the game, or due to external biases. Metrics are defined using measures of centrality and connectivity to gauge in-game performance, and external data is used to assess a country's economic and cultural footprint.

## Research Questions
1. What country articles do players cross through?
2. Do they choose these countries to get better success in-game?
3. Is their choice of countries motivated by external biases?

## Methods
After starting over from our P2 deliverable, we had to first look at success rates when related
- We started by looking for biases related to continental placement

**_Note:_** we were working on skewed data therefore were unable to draw any conclusive results about the players. However, we have come up with good performance metrics e.g. mean time per page. These can be used to create a performance score that is more representative (taking into account the individual factors that at first glance might leed to beleiving that there is no improvement at all), which, in combination with the difficulty of the level that we are able to estimate, may lead us to the correlations and relationships we are looking for.

## Timeline
1. **Week 3-5:** Brainstorming: Each member comes up with 3 different ideas to be assessed by the TAs
2. **Week 7-9:** Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and extract relevant features.
   - Identify patterns and trends within user behavior.
   - Visualize key insights and relationships within the dataset.
3. **Week 12-14:** Statistical and Final Analysis and Documentation
   - Apply statistical methods to further confirm relationships between variables.
   - Conduct hypothesis testing to validate findings.
   - Summarize key findings and insights.
   - Prepare the final documentation to be presented.
